1. Argon Combat HUD extenstion for Rolemaster Unitied (RMU): Integrates Argon Combat HUD for RMU with some additional features specifically for RMU

2. Visage: A system-agnostic module that allows a token's owner (player or GM) to add additional token art to the token within the token's configuration dialogue and then, via the token's HUD, quickly change both the token's name and art so you can apply disguises, illusions, shapeshift forms, etc. It will store the original naem and image path and provide a quick way to return to the defaults. This is purely a visual change of token name and  image.
